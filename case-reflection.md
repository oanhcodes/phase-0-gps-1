# What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I'm doing well so far. I did a poor job and got a bad grade on an assignment, so I was refocused on putting in more effort.

# What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

By watching, explaining, and doing in git, I feel very confident with the general framework of pushing and pulling content.

# What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I checked in and asked for a lot of clarification of thought processes. I asked John about alternative ways of doing things. I checked in with Linda often, maybe too often, when I was driving.

# What still confuses you about git?

Nothing from what I've learned so far. I'm sure there will be plenty of room to be confused in the future.

# How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was a good experience. I learned that I need to find a balance of putting my information out there, yet not talking too much as to disrupt thought processes when I am navigating. I think I can be a great navigator, but my I am more comfortable driving.
