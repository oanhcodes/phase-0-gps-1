##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Before starting this session, I had a good idea about git workflow. It was nice to practice and reinforce my understanding. I have not practiced fixing merge conflicts, so I was looking forward to working through the challenge with my pair.

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
How to fix a merge conflict and the importance of creating feature-branches in the right directory.

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Jonathan asked our guide, John, about his experience at DBC. We also asked for feedback about our GPS. I asked questions throughout the session to confirm I was on the right track.

##What still confuses you about git?
I understand not sure when and if using fetch/merge is better than pull.

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I had a positive experience during my first GPS. Both my pair and phase 0 guide were very patient and helpful in navigating me through the errors I encountered. Although I was initially very nervous, I quickly felt comfortable and enjoyed getting feedback when I was driving. During this first session, I found myself watching and observing in the navigator seat. In future sessions, I will work towards giving more input and guiding when I am a navigator.
